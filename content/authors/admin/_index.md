My research approach integrates field observations, microstructure analysis, rock experiments, and geophysics to identify earthquake records within faults. I aim to understand the impact of stress changes and transient fluid pressure on fault slip and earthquake cycles. Additionally, I collaborate closely with seismologists in our mission to uncover earthquake triggers and new active faults.
